# Virtual Mouse Implementation using OpenCV

This is a simple project implemented using Python's OpenCV library that detects green blocks and implements them as a virtual mouse.

When two pieces of green paper are worn to your index and thumb fingers, this program detects your fingers' motion and tries to implement the motion onto your computer's mouse.

When the fingers are separated, the program implements simple mouse movement and when the two fingers are pinched, the program detects that as a click.

To make this work,

1)Wear two pieces of green paper to your index and thumb fingers.

2)Run the code (After installing all necessary libraries (OpenCV3, pynput, numpy, wxpython))

3)Run the program, Grant camera permissions if any

4)Move your fingers around and have fun!

This is a simple fun project and is done in short time. It has many implementation defects and though this project works good, it needs a lot more fine tuning.
